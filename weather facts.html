<p>
This currently holds the record for hottest air temperature ever recorded. <br/>
The desert valley reached highs of <strong><u>56.7 degrees in the summer of 1913,</u></strong> 
which would apparently push the limits of human survival. <br/>
Average temperatures today reach 47 degrees during summer, and it’s the driest place in the States.</p>

style="height:20%;width:30%">
<p>
Studies conducted by NASA have concluded that this desert located in northern Chile is in fact the driest desert in the world.
<br/> Some weather stations in the Atacama<strong> have never received rain.</strong>
<br/> Periods of up to four years have been registered with no rainfall in the central sector, delimited by the cities of Antofagasta, Calama and Copiapó, in Chile. 
<br/>Evidence suggests that the Atacama <strong><u> Desert may not have had any significant rainfall from 1570 to 1971.</u></strong>

style="height:20%;width:30%">
<p>
Mawsynram, located in the Meghalaya State in India, is the wettest place in the world,<strong><u> with an annual rainfall of 11,871 millimeters.</u></strong>
<br/> The large volume of rain is caused by the Himalayas Ranges blocking heavy clouds’ escape to the North. 
<br/>The region’s rainfall rises to 12 meters, making the area home to rivers and waterfalls.
<br/> The dwellers of Mawsynram have adapted to the wet conditions and never leave the house without an umbrella.
<br/> The residents make basket-like covers with reeds, to block out the rain as they work in the fields. 
<br/>The villagers make use of grass as soundproof for their huts. 
The drier periods in the region are considered to be between December and January when the rainfall can amount to a mere 60 millimeters.
