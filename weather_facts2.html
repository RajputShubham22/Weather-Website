All refer to phenomena that occur in the upper atmosphere in the regions around thunderstorms. They appear as cones, glows and discharges. 
<br>They were only discovered last century, because of their placement and their very brief life-span (they last less than a second).

<p>
Norway is known as the land of midnight sun. Due to Norway's high altitude, there are seasonal variations in daylight because of the period of refracted sunlight is long. 
In this country, for about a period of 76 days from late May to late July, the sun never sets for about 20 hours.

style="height:20%;width:30%">

<p>
In most parts of this country, 
the sun shines for straight 73 hours during summers and the citizens of this country experience no sunlight during winters. 
<br>The midnight sun shines above the Arctic circle, but here the sun briefly dips beyond the horizon and then rises again which results in blurring of the boundary between dying night and dawning day.
